# Idea

The domain perl6book.com was meant as a landing page for Moritz' Perl 6
book, which is now called [Perl 6
Fundamentals](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484228982), and for
which the publisher now has a landing page.

So, let's re-purpose it into an overview of current Perl 6 books.

Maybe, as a gimmick, add a flow chart that helps deciding which Perl 6
book to read.
